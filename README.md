	1. Gatsby will automatically generate routes based on the file structure (src/pages).
	
	2. We can add external plugins such as typescript, sass file, typography etc.
	
	3. We can add layouts for entire screens in the app in an easy manner(src/components/layout).
	
	4. Developers can use GraphQL to query data from various sources, including local files, databases, and APIs. We have the graphql test area to check whether the query return the correct output or not before using in the site.
	
Gatsby is designed with performance in mind. It automatically optimizes images, lazy-loads assets, and generates optimized code for fast page loads.
